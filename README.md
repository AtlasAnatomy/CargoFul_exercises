## Overview

This repository demonstrates my approaches to various data analysis and algorithm development challenges. Each exercise includes structured, self-contained code to allow for easy understanding and reproducibility of results.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This exercise involves analyzing and forecasting time series data for POS (points of sale) to predict future values for each location ID. The steps include data preprocessing, handling outliers, prioritizing specific POS IDs, and using a time series forecasting model.

#### Solution Outline:
1. **Dataset Quality Assessment**: Examine dataset structure, check for missing values, and review key patterns.
2. **POS IDs Prioritization**: Prioritize Point of Sale (POS) IDs based on forecast relevance.
3. **Outliers Cleaning**: Remove or adjust outliers to improve forecast accuracy.
4. **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
5. **Time Series Algorithm**: Apply a forecasting model to account for time-based trends and seasonality.
6. **Algorithm Assessment**: Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like RMSE or MAE.

### Exercise 2: Spatial Analytics

This exercise focuses on spatial data analysis, aimed at uncovering geographic patterns through clustering and distance calculations.

#### Solution Outline:
1. **Spatial Clustering**: Group data points based on geographic proximity.
2. **Distance Calculations**: Calculate distances between locations for spatial analysis.
3. **Visualization**: Generate maps to visualize spatial patterns.

### Exercise 3: SQL

The third exercise consists of SQL-based solutions for complex data retrieval and manipulation.

#### Solution Outline:
- **SQL Scripts**: Each query is optimized for efficient data extraction and manipulation. These SQL scripts are located in the `sql_queries/` directory, with a test function `test_sql_queries()` provided for performance validation.
